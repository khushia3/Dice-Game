## 🧰 Tech Stack

- ✅ HTML5 for structure  
- 🎨 CSS3 for styling  
- 🧠 JavaScript for logic and DOM manipulation  
- 🎲 Custom dice images

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Each time the page is refreshed:
   - Two random numbers (1–6) are generated.
   - The dice images update based on those numbers.
   - A winner is displayed at the top (Player 1, Player 2, or Draw).

- How to generate random numbers in JavaScript
- How to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Image source swapping using `setAttribute()`
- Conditional logic (`if/else`) in real-world projects
